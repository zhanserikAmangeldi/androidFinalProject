**Topic: Weather apps**
API: https://open-meteo.com/en/

The applications will have three pages:
1. Home, with viewing detailed information about the weather for today (clockwise) and at this moment
2. Secondary page, viewing the weather for ten days in advance (only max and min temperatures will be shown), by clicking on each you can see more detailed information (Optionally, see how much time will be left)
3. Setting with location, measurement system and language


For now:
